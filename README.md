# Task S1.03 - Java Collections

**Objectives**:
Work with Java Collections Framework structures such as ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, and ListIterator.
Handle duplicates and object comparison.
Practice object sorting (Comparable, Comparator).
Practice file input/output operations.
Implement menus and user interaction.

## 📌 Level 1

### Exercise 1 – Duplicates
Create a class named Month with a name attribute that stores the month name.
- Add 11 Month objects to an ArrayList, leaving out August
- Insert August in the correct position
- Verify that the month order is correct
- Convert the ArrayList into a HashSet and verify that duplicates are not allowed
- Iterate through the collection using:
- A for loop
- An Iterator

### Exercise 2 – ListIterator
- Create and populate a List<Integer>
- Create a second list and insert the same elements in reverse order
- Use a ListIterator to read elements from the first list and insert them into the second

### Exercise 3 – Capital Game
Using the file countries.txt (provided in resources), which contains country–capital pairs separated by commas:
- Read the file contents
- Store the data in a HashMap<String, String>
	- Key → Country name
	- Value → Capital city

Game behavior:
- The program asks for the user's name
- The game generates 10 random questions
- Each question displays a country name
- The user must input the correct capital
- Correct answers add 1 point
- After 10 questions, the final score is displayed
- The program saves the username and score into classificacio.txt
